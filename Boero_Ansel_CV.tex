\section{\faFileText}{SUMMARY}
I am a Data Engineer with over three years of experience in the consulting industry, specializing in the Life Sciences and Banking domains.\\While at a major Italian bank, I contributed to the migration of demographic data, gaining exposure to all stages of the data engineering lifecycle, with a focus on Data Modeling and Data Quality.\\Now, I've been working as a Migration specialist in the Life Science Domain, and I have optimized an internal ETL tool, achieving a performance boost of over 100\%.\\I'm always looking to improve my skills and am currently exploring a Python wrapper for Veeva APIs to enhance my software engineering abilities (OOP, TDD, documentation, CI/CD). Additionally, I'm currently studying for the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer certification.
